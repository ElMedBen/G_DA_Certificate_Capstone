#  Google's Data Analytics Capstone

This certificate was my first entry into the world of data analytics. Thanks to Google and Coursera, i was able to learn new concepts and skills that can be very helpful and critical in the field of geoscience, as well as any other Data centric subjects

## Capstone general infos ..

At the end of the certificate, i was tasked to choose one of two case studies to apply all what i have learned during the course : 

* Ask the right questions
* Prepare Data for Exploration
* Process and clean Data
* Analyze Data to answer questions
* Share data with simple and relevant visualizations
* Act !

With these important guidelines in mind , i have chosen to conduct the analysis on a fictional bike sharing company (First case study out of two proposed)
